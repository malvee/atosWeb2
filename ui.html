				There are 2 stages that needed processing before we actually decided on how our UI will look like. The first stage included the making of 3 powerpoint slides (one per group member) in which we have described our personal idea about how the UI should look like. We started with the same template and added specific features. After seeing advantages and disdvantages and checking Norman's principles, we have decided to go on with the UI presented in the <a href="prototypes.html">"Prototypes"</a> file for both the prototype due the end of December and the final project, which is due the end of the academic year. In fact, this is the second part of our UI process and required adequate attention and research.The points that needed to be highlighted in the presentation were: 
			</p>
			<p id="marginlength" style="margin-top: -8em">
				<ul>
					<li>Understanding of user needs (note these are not the same as the system requirements)</li>
					<li>The slides should show clearly how users would interact with the system</li>
					<li>The UI design applies some of Norman’s design principles (affordance, feedback, visibility, consistency, constraints)</li>
					<li> The slides should demonstrate that we have created a lo-fi prototype of all or part of their UI design and used an appropriate evaluation method to evaluate their low-fi prototype with a minimum of two participants.</li>
					<li> There is evidence of reflection on the implications of the user evaluations for future iterations of their UI design.</li>
