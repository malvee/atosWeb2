				ATOS is a company that takes care of the welfare of the railways services and tries to make travelling by train easier for customers. This includes everything from entering the station to finding a place in the desired train. They are now looking for a new approach and try to refresh their services in order to make them better. This is where we come in. The aim of our project is to analyze some of the most important social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) for possible feedback from the customers in real time. Using the feedback that we will find regarding some issues in the station or in the trains we will then in turn enable responsible people to solve the issues. Train operating companies and Network Rail monitor social media (predominantly Facebook and Twitter) as a way of managing customer satisfaction. The greatest success with this approach is when the information can be acted upon quickly. For example, a passenger complains on Twitter that their train is not showing a platform and 30 seconds later the platform is posted and there is a response on Twitter detailing the action that has been taken.The challenge is how to route the information available on Twitter and Facebook rapidly to the correct people and/or systems that are able to take the appropriate corrective action.The aim of this project is to develop a product that can be configured to automatically route social media activity to the most appropriate person(s) and/or system(s) to enable a fast response.A possible further extension is to allow the person/system that actions a response to reply to the original reporter with details of the action that was taken.Another possible extension is the provision of a dashboard that shows an analysis of activity in social media channels in real time including a summary of which have been routed for action and which have been actioned.

				More clearly, in order for the project to be a success, we should:
				<ul>
					<li>Get real tweets and/or facebook posts fed into the UI of the app</li>
					<li>Have a sensible sentiment analysis in-built </li>
					<li>Have a good built UI and and a webpage that displays that</li>
 				</ul>



				Our client has decided we are going to work useing the SCRUM method, which involves us working in 2-weeks sprints, having a meeting after each of these sprints in order to decide what we are going to do next and to check the progress of the app. The summary of each of the sprints can be found in the ”Archive” sector of the application, within the bi-weekly report files. We hereby attach a table including the overview of the project for its whole duration:
